Scenario 1 :
Bad weather,any kind of optical sensor will not work, GPS signal available
Receiver antennas on four or eight sides of the vehicle or a radar antenna. 
Martin C suggests improved camera vision in bad weather

Scenario 2 :
Good weather
GPS sensor in the vehicle is not working and giving out random values.
Or maybe the vehicle crashed and cannot move or localise itself. 
Drone can be sent to the last known good GPS location to find and provide gps cordinates and safe removal of the vehicle. 
Drone based localisation  with image processing. Vehicle rescue drone. Drone charging and deployment docks can be placed above traffic/lamp posts.
Elaboration :
A distress signal to the server.
Last known GPS location is fetched. 
Drone moves to the last known gps location.
Takes 360 degree photos from last known location and a fixed altitude, 
If the searching vehicle is found in the image drone moves to the vehicle and sends the gps values to the server.

Scenario 3 :
Everything is normal. 
As presented in the paper, we can use antenna arrays to detect a curve that is ahead of us. 
But, Martin C is not in favour of antenna or radio waves, he says implementation will be difficult.


Scenario 4 :
Bad weather.
LOS methods like camera and sonar are not working
Using RFID tags attached to lamp posts and buildings/moving vehicles we can localise our robots.
GPS co-cordinates encoded in the RFID tag.
Can be used for localisation on road.
